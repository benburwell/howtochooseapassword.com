# How to Choose a Password

This is an educational site geared to the general public that uses the [Plain
Language guidelines](https://plainlanguage.gov/) to provide information on
password security.

There are two primary use cases:

1. As a reference to be shared with family and friends so you donâ€™t need to keep
   typing out the same material all the time.
2. To be linked to by apps and websites in their password creation user
   interfaces. If you are responsible for implementing a password UI, feel free
   to link to <https://howtochooseapassword.com> or use some or all of the text.
