      <h2>
        <a name="why">
          Why strong passwords are important
        </a>
      </h2>

      <p>
        When choosing a password, it’s important to make sure that no one can
        guess it — that’s the whole point, right?
      </p>

      <p>
        If we want to make sure no one can guess our passwords, we need to
        think about what <strong>adversaries</strong> might be trying to guess
        them and how they might do it. This is part of a process called
        <strong>threat modeling</strong>. Some adversaries we can think about
        are:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>People who know us.</strong> Our friends know a lot about us,
          like our birthday, our pets’ names, our favorite songs, and other
          personal information. Even if we’re not worried about friends
          guessing our passwords, an adversary might easily find these details
          on the Internet, so we shouldn’t use any of these things in our
          passwords.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>People who know a password we’ve used in the past.</strong>
          Unfortunately, it’s not unusual for passwords to be discovered by
          adversaries. This might happen if a website or app we use is
          compromised, or if a computer we type our password on has been
          infected with malware. This means it’s a bad idea to create a new
          password by making a variation of another one.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>People who know a lot of common passwords.</strong> Some
          adversaries have compiled “password dictionaries” containing
          thousands of commonly used passwords. Even if an adversary is not
          specifically trying to find <em>our</em> password, they might use
          lists like this to discover our password if it is one of the common
          ones.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>
          The way to make sure that no one can guess our passwords is to make
          them completely random.
        </strong>
        When our passwords are randomly generated, they don’t have any
        information related to us that friends might be able to guess. If an
        adversary learns one of our passwords, they will be no closer to
        guessing any of our other passwords.  And of course, randomly generated
        passwords are very unlikely to be listed in password dictionaries.
      </p>

      <h2>
        <a name="generate">
          How to generate a random password
        </a>
      </h2>

      <p>
        Being truly random is something that people are very bad at. Even when
        we <em>think</em> we are being random, there are often patterns
        associated with the “random” things we come up with.
      </p>

      <p>
        When we want to create good, random passwords, one thing we can use is
        software (such as our password manager, more on this below) to help us.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another method is to use a word list and dice to create a random
        passphrase. The
        <a href="https://www.eff.org">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>,
        a digital privacy advocacy group, has created
        <a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2016/07/18/eff_large_wordlist.txt">
          a wordlist you can download
        </a>
        for this purpose. To use this method, you’ll need five dice (or you can
        roll a single die five times). Here’s how:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Roll five dice (or one die five times) and read the number from each
          so that you have five digits, for example: 1, 6, 3, 5, 2.
        </li>
        <li>
          Look at
          <a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2016/07/18/eff_large_wordlist.txt">
            the wordlist
          </a>
          to find the word next to the number you rolled.
          In this case, we find the line <code>16352 comfort</code>, so our
          word word is <strong>comfort</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Repeat the first two steps until you have at least six words. You
          will end up with a random phrase like
          <strong>comfort tableful booth tulip dandelion stable</strong>
          which is your new random passphrase.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make up a little story to help remember the passphrase. For example:
          “The diner had a <strong>comfort</strong>able
          <strong>tableful</strong> in the <strong>booth</strong> with
          <strong>tulip</strong>s and <strong>dandelion</strong>s in a
          <strong>stable</strong> vase.”
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        If an adversary wanted to guess our passphrase, even if they had our
        wordlist and knew exactly how we created it, they would need to
        correctly guess 30 random die rolls in the right order. The probability
        of this is 1 in 221,073,919,720,733,357,899,776. It is
        <em>extremely</em> unlikely they would be successful, as it would take
        three billion years of making a million guesses every second before
        they would be likely to succeed.
      </p>

          How to remember your passwords
        </a>
      </h2>

      <p>
        It’s also important not to use the same password twice. Imagine if we
        generate a completely random password and use it for our email account,
        and we also use it for a social media site. If an adversary learns our
        email address and password for the social media site, they could easily
        try that same password on our email account, and since we used the same
        random password, they would succeed easily. This is why you should only
        use each password for a single site.
      </p>

      <p>
        When there are a lot of different things we need passwords for, it
        quickly becomes hard to remember all of them. Luckily, we can use a
        <strong>password manager</strong> to help us out. Password managers are
        software programs that help us securely store our passwords.
      </p>

      <p>
        Imagine writing down all of our passwords on a sheet of paper, and then
        scrambling them all up according to a secret pattern. Even though
        someone might look at the paper, they won’t be able to figure out any
        of our passwords without knowing the secret pattern we used to scramble
        them. Password managers use a similar idea; they use a
        <strong>master passphrase</strong> to encrypt the list of all of our
        passwords. The master passphrase is like the scrambling pattern: an
        adversary can access the list of all our passwords if and only if they
        discover the master passphrase.
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s very important to use a long, randomly generated master passphrase
        because all of our passwords are only as good as our master passphrase.
        When we use a password manager, we only need to remember our passphrase
        to unlock our list of passwords. The password manager stores all of our
        other passwords for us.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another benefit to using a password manager is that they help us
        generate new passwords when we need them. Rather than rolling dice
        every time we sign up for a new account, we can let your password
        manager come up with completely random password for us. Since our
        password manager also stores the new password for us, we never even
        need to know what it is! We can just copy and paste it when we need to
        log in.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are several password managers available. You should do some
        research to find one that will work for you. Here are a few suggestions
        to start with:
