      <h1>How to Choose a Password</h1>

      <p>
        It’s important to choose passwords that satisfy two basic requirements:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>No one should be able to guess it,</strong>
          either based on what they know about you, by simply guessing common
          passwords, or based on other passwords they know you’ve used.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>It should grant access to only one thing.</strong>
          You should assume that the password <em>will</em> be compromised, and
          when it is, the attacker should not be able to use that information to
          gain access to any of your other accounts.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Use long, random passwords</h2>
      <p>
        The easiest way to make sure that no one can guess your password is to
        make it completely random. Using random passwords helps achieve the
        principles above because:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          It automatically won’t have any information associated with you, such
          as a pet’s or family member’s name.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you need to change your password, it’s easy to come up with a
          completely new one rather than just changing <code>randomness</code> to
          <code>randomness1</code>, then to <code>randomness2</code> and so on.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A good, random password depends on <em>entropy</em>, which is a measure
        of the amount of information it contains. Some passwords that
        <em>appear</em> random and secure are not. For example,
        <code>zxcvbn</code> <em>looks</em> like a bunch of random letters, but is
        actually a common password because it’s the first six keys on the bottom
        row of the QWERTY keyboard.
      </p>

      <h2>Use a password manager to help you remember</h2>
      <p>
        Unless you have a superhuman memory, you won’t be able to remember all
        the long, random passwords that you have. A great solution to this
        problem is to use a password manager. Password managers are software
        programs that run on your computer and/or mobile phone that securely
        store your passwords and guard them with a master passphrase.
      </p>
      <p>
        A good password manager uses your passphrase to encrypt all of your
        passwords. This means that even the company who makes the software does
        not have access to your secret passwords; the only way someone could
        access them is by knowing your passphrase.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another benefit to using a password manager is that they help you
        generate new passwords when you need them. Here are a few recommendations:
